# Payment Gateway Integration
Task-3 under Web and Android Development in GRIP TSF internship

## Features
- basic site, only html and css
- all there is, is a button that just links to your razorpay payment page
- the razorpay payments page does everything

# Details
- hosted right here on github: https://icaran.github.io/helpTSF/

- my submission for TSF JAN2022: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/karanpratapshaw_youtube-activity-6885273666247118848-n3wO

## Build yourself
- register for a razor pay account
- do NOT do KYC, just keep it a dummy account with fake money, it's good enougb for learning purposes
- in the Dashboard, navigate to Payment Pages
- create a new Payment Page of Events and Tickets type
- and add the details you want to like in there
- in the Payment Receipts menu in the Payment Page creation page, make sure to check the option "send receipts autonatically"
- Save the page and copy the newly created page url
- replace the link in line 40 of [index.html](https://github.com/iCaran/helpTSF/blob/main/index.html) with your link

Done
